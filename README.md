# Smart-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System

# Introduction
This is a simple Air Quality Monitoring System based on these two sensors :

* MQ135(smoke/gas)
* MQ-7(carbon monoxide)

A buzzer and couple of LEDS are used to indicate the severity of the situation with LCD giving detailed information about surrounding air quality.

The schematic diagram shows the connections between the Arduino board, the LCD 
display, the gas sensor, and the alarm components (buzzer and LEDs).
